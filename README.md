Shabd Sampadaa शब्द सम्पदा
========================

This is a descendant of the [Hindi Wordnet](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/) project of Centre for Indian Language Technology, IIT Mumbai.
Hindi Wordnet is in Java. Shabd Sampadaa converts it to a PHP MySQL application and exposes a basic word search API.

Shabd Sampadaa is available under the GNU GPL v3 license.

To speed up development the PHP framework Laravel 4.2 has been used. Lumen would be quite sufficient too actually.

A working copy of Shabd Sampadaa can be seen at [http://manaskriti.com/shabd-sampadaa](http://manaskriti.com/shabd-sampadaa).

The downloaded Hindi Wordnet code and database is available in the JHWNL_1_2 and HindiWN_1_4 folders.
