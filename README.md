Shabd Sampadaa
==============

This is a descendant of the [Hindi Wordnet](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/) project of Centre for Indian Language Technology, IIT Mumbai.
Hindi Wordnet is in Java. Shabd Sampadaa has converted it to a PHP application and exposed a basic word search as an API.

Shabd Sampadaa is available under the GNU GPL v2 license.

To speed up development the PHP framework Laravel 4.2 has been used. Lumen would be quite sufficient too actually.

A working copy of Shabd Sampadaa can be seen at [http://manaskriti.com/shabd-sampadaa](http://manaskriti.com/shabd-sampadaa).

The downloaded Hindi Wordnet code and database is available in the JHWNL_1_2 and HindiWN_1_4 folders.
